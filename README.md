# Hi there 👋, I’m Avinash — Ops-to-Software Engineer

Career switcher with 10+ years optimizing finance & multi-location retail operations, now building reliable backend services and pragmatic full-stack features. I like turning messy, manual workflows into clear code and docs.

- 🎓 **BCIT, Computer Systems Technology (Distinction, 2025)** — OOP, data structures, DB design, web & mobile, DevOps
- 🧩 Strengths: analytical problem-solving, process automation, clear documentation, getting things production-ready
- 🎯 Goal: join an entry-level team where I can contribute to real products, improve code quality, and grow under mentorship

### ⚙️ Tech I use
**Backend & APIs:** Laravel (PHP), Node.js/Express  
**Frontend (simple UIs):** React, Vue  
**Data:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL reporting  
**Languages from coursework:** Java, Python, C  
**DevOps basics:** Docker, Git/GitHub, GitHub Actions  
**Ops toolkit:** VBA/Excel automation, reconciliation & reporting pipelines

### 🛠️ Things I’ve built
- **RESTful APIs** (Laravel/Node) with auth, validation, pagination, and SQL-backed features  
- **Simple React/Vue front ends** to visualize metrics, uploads, and dashboards  
- **Data workflows** that reconcile POS revenue with carrier statements, flag variances, and produce audit-friendly logs  
- **Automation** that replaces recurring manual reports with scripts and scheduled jobs

> I care about: small, well-named functions; clear README/setup steps; tests for critical logic; and leaving things easier to maintain.
